Thief Sheep

Thief Sheep pits two people against each other in a high pressure, unrelenting, and unforgiving scenario. The shepherd (player 1) has family coming over in 1 minute and 30 seconds, and wants his guests to have the best experience possible. He needs to capture the thief sheep (player 2) before his guests arrive, to ensure the sheep doesn't wreak havok on his farm, or steal any of his or his families belongings. 

The first player plays as the shepherd, and the second plays as the thief sheep. Both share the same screen. The idea is that the shepherd must catch the thief sheep before the time limit runs out. The thief sheep must hide from the shepherd, and can do so by imitating his fellow sheep around him.
